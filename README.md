# Magic Eight Ball 🎱

A simple JavaScript project that prints a random “Magic Eight Ball” answer.  
Built while learning control flow (if/else, switch), variables, and basic console output.

## Demo
- Run locally: open `index.html` in your browser (or use GitHub Pages once enabled).
- Console output will show the greeting, the question, and the Eight Ball’s answer.

## How It Works
1. (Optional) Greets the user if a name is set.
2. Logs the user’s question.
3. Generates a random number from **0–7**.
4. Uses a `switch` statement to map that number to one of eight classic responses.

## Technologies
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML (for a simple runner page)
